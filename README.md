# Edubase

The UK government website provides information about schools from its Edubase
system.
The file edubase_data.csv is a sample of that data.

Using Python, write a script to load the CSV file to a database.

Answer the following questions using a method of your choice (show your

1. How many open primary schools are there in Tower Hamlets?

2. Give a list of the districts (districtadministrative_name) that have
had the most schools close since 2000

3. Calculate the percentage breakdown of open schools in each Local Authority
